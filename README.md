📖 View all books with availability and timestamps

✅ Borrow a book (marks as borrowed and logs borrow time)

🔁 Return a book (marks as available and clears borrow time)

➕ Add new books with timestamps

💾 Data persistence using a library.txt file

🗂️ File Structure
── library.txt          # Book database (auto-created if not found)
── main.py              # Main Python script
